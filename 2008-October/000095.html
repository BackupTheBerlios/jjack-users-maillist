<PRE>Hello Arnout,

</I>
Absolutely right, adding MIDI support to JJack will be the next 
consequential step for a following release. I also don't think it is too 
hard, but still will be some days of work to do it thoroughly.

Besides that, the audio part of JJack needs further work because it 
doesn't yet run stable in all environments. And, if possible, JJack 
should provide some additional management functionality for 
connecting/disconnecting ports. So there is quite a wishlist for a next 
release...

&gt;<i> I don't see any recent updates to CVS. Has development moved elsewhere?
</I>
...please be patient. Development will carry on, but most likely not 
before 2009. I've recently had some communication with Dave Phillips 
(author of &quot;Java Sound &amp; Music Software for Linux&quot;) who pointed me to 
the Jacklab Audio Distribution, and I have set up a development 
environment on that system. This is very inspiring, I hope there'll be 
some time during the next months to work with it.

&gt;<i> From what I've seen neither the current Java Sound API implementations
</I>&gt;<i> nor JJack support JACK or ALSA MIDI.
</I>
I think the stock Java Sound implementation can do ALSA Midi, at least 
in the sense that it provides access to physical MIDI devices. This 
might be something you can use until JJack MIDI is available.

Best,
Jens
