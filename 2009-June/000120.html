<PRE>Hi Peter and jjack-users,

apologies for not replying earlier. I guess you were right. I was  
probably still linking to an earlier jjack! Sorry for that.

Also, I'd like to say a big congratulations for jjack. It's a great  
solution for Java audio, especially on OSX which seems to have pretty  
rubbish support for JavaSound. I'm sure I'll be making lots of use of  
it in the future, especially for multichannel work.

I'm still a bit new to the jack commandline tools and the basic  
principles of setting up a jack client. At the moment I'm running a  
multichannel installation (one input and four outputs). A script  
starts jackdmp with the correct configuration, then I run my Java  
program, using the Jjack JavaSound wrapper and the autoconnect flag.  
This works nicely. One thing though is that I'm getting occasional  
crackles and correspondingly, seeing messages in the commandline,  
mostly....

JackActivationCount::Signal value = 0 ref =3

It's quite cryptic to me. Would I be right in assuming that this is  
the result of audio frames not being calculated quickly enough in my  
Java program, causing dropouts for Jack? I have tried setting a nice  
large system buffer size when creating my SourceDataLine to remove the  
glitches. But I suspect given the goal of low-latency realtime  
performance, JJack doesn't actually use this buffering cue -- i.e.,  
you can't make up for lost time, frames need to be calculated right  
away. Is that correct?

Cheers,

Ollie

</I>&gt;<i> jack_client_new: deprecated
</I>&gt;<i> This is weird; one of the first things I did was to get rid of the

</I>&gt;<i> strange, though, because the new Java code (JJackNativeClient.java)

</I>&gt;<i> build_macosx.xml&quot; in the make directory?  You may also have to  
</I>&gt;<i> delete the old Mac binaries that come with the svn checkout.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another question: I don't see a way to query JJackSystem (e.g., to
</I>&gt;<i> find out how many channels or what the buffer size is before you
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> embark on this process callback), or to remote control Jack in any way
</I>&gt;<i> (e.g., tell it how many channels / buffer size, make connections, or
</I>&gt;<i> start and stop jackd). Are these things possible?
</I>&gt;<i> If you're using the original JJack functionality (fully preserved in  
</I>&gt;<i> the new version), then you can set the number of channels through  
</I>&gt;<i> system properties.  If you're using the new functionality, then you  
</I>&gt;<i> can open and close an arbitrary number of Jack clients and specify  
</I>&gt;<i> the number of input and output ports for each of them; you can also  
</I>&gt;<i> specify the names of clients to connect to.  JJackNativeClient.java  
</I>&gt;<i> also comes with static methods that'll report the sample rate and  
</I>&gt;<i> buffer size.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for starting and stopping Jack, it would be a trivial change to  
</I>&gt;<i> automatically start Jack when opening a client (just pass an  
</I>&gt;<i> additional flag to jack_client_open), but for the time being I  
</I>&gt;<i> decided against that because it would be a bit of a departure from  
</I>&gt;<i> the original functionality of JJack.
</I>&gt;<i> Hope this helps,
</I>&gt;<i>      Peter
