<PRE>Hi Peter,

Thank for the swift response.  I was aware when I wrote of some of the
work you'd done on adding support for multiple clients, which meets
parts of my needs. However, I also want access to other aspects of the
Jack API (MIDI, transport, connections, etc). I'm under the impression
that this isn't being worked on at the moment, which is why I started
looking at binding the full Jack API with JNA.

I should have most of the audio API done this week, and will have a
look at the other aspects as soon as I get the time. As I'm using JNA
the performance of the audio callback is always going to be a bit
behind the custom JNI code in JJack (though it should improve when the
new SVN version of JNA is released), but the two layers should be able
to operate side by side.  If there was a way of getting JJack's client
pointer across to JNA, it would even be possible to get access to the
many client functions that JJack currently doesn't give access to,
while retaining the current performance on the RT thread.

As I said in my previous email, I'm not trying to compete with what
JJack provides, but offer a simple access layer to other aspects of
the Jack API that I need, and I know other people on this list have
asked about.

Best wishes,

Neil

&gt;<i> Hi Neil,
</I>&gt;<i> I also came up against the singe client limitation, and I reworked JJack so
</I>&gt;<i> that it now supports multiple clients. &#160;I also slimmed down the jack process
</I>&gt;<i> callback so that you may see a small performance increase. &#160;You can find the
</I>&gt;<i> new version at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/jjack/branches/v04-proposal.">http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/jjack/branches/v04-proposal.</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The original functionality of JJack remains unchanged, but the native bridge
</I>&gt;<i> moved into a new class called JJackNativeClient that is a minimal wrapper
</I>&gt;<i> for the native code.
</I>&gt;<i> Best,
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;Peter
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> PS: &#160;I made a number of changes since I last wrote to this list. &#160;In
</I>&gt;<i> particular, I removed the small difference in thread attachment that I
</I>&gt;<i> mentioned earlier, so that the original functionality of JJack is now fully
</I>&gt;<i> preserved, and I updated the ant buildfile to work for both Mac and Linux.
