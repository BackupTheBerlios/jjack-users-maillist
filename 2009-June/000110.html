<PRE>Hello JJack users and developers,

Peter Brinkmann has contributed substantial changes to libjjack.c and 
JJackSystem.java. They are a complete re-implementation of the native 
client architecture and promise to solve a number of performance issues. 
I have not done any practical tests yet, but looked into the code and 
have found several useful improvements (see the list of changes below).

Peter's code is available on an SVN-branch at

<A HREF="https://&lt;developername">https://&lt;developername</A>&gt;@svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/jjack/branches/v04-proposal

Changed files:
src/de/gulden/framework/jjack/JJackAudioEvent.java
src/de/gulden/framework/jjack/JJackNativeClient.java (new)
src/de/gulden/framework/jjack/JJackNativeClientEvent.java (new)
src/de/gulden/framework/jjack/JJackNativeClientListener.java (new)
src/de/gulden/framework/jjack/JJackSystem.java
src/de/gulden/framework/jjack/libjjack.c
make/build_macosx.xml (new)
make/build.xml

I have called this &quot;version 0.4 proposal&quot;. We can discuss including 
other changes (maybe from the Frinika project?) before merging them into 
trunk and finally building a 0.4 release.

New features are:

- The native bridge now lives in a new class (JJackNativeClient.java), 
which is a minimal wrapper for native jack clients. It is now possible 
to create multiple clients, open, close, etc., without restarting the JVM

- The process callback is significantly smaller than before, which 
hopefully reduces the amount of zombifications.

- There now is a shutdown call (with listeners), so at least you get 
notified when you are zombified.

- Init and destroy now implicitly happen automatically, and in addition 
every client has a finalize-method, so there are no leaks.

- Despite all changes, JJackSystem should behave exactly like before 
(except the thread-issue mentioned above). Besides JJackSystem.java, 
libjjack.c and a small addition in JJackAudioEvent.java, no files have 
been changed.

- Inside the process-callback, as few new object instances as possible 
are created.

- There now is a build-file for MacOS.

Feedback on this is very helpful for building a version 0.4 release. So 
everyone is welcome to give comments.

Best,
Jens
