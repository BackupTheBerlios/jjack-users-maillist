<PRE>Hello everybody,
Just a few words to set up some context for my take on JJack:

  - I'm using JJack in the audio components of jReality (www.jreality.de).
In particular, the idea is to render an Ambisonics B-signal and use JACK to
pipe the B-signal into an Ambisonics decoder such as Fons Adriaensen's
ambdec, so that I needed the ability to autoconnect to all kinds of JACK
ports, not just physical ports.

- A jReality application may need to connect to several JACK clients at once
(e.g., it might connect to ambdec for Ambisonics output as well as various
soft synths for input), and so it made sense to have several clients, each
of which autoconnects to a different list of ports.  Moreover, the
collection of JACK clients may depend on user interaction, so that I needed
a way of adding or removing clients on the fly.

  - I encountered a lot of zombifications on an underpowered (albeit not
quite obsolete) Linux box, and so I needed a way to restart my JACK
components without restarting the entire application.

  - If you're only interested in the original functionality of JJack, then
the new version should look the same to you, with one minor difference:  The
new version attaches JACK threads as daemon threads, so that a Java
application will terminate if the only remaining threads are JACK threads.
If you have any applications that expect to stay alive as long as their JACK
threads are alive, please let me know.  Restoring the original functionality
would be trivial, but for my purposes (lots of JACK threads that are
subordinate to graphics and user interaction threads) it makes more sense to
attach JACK threads as daemons.

Any thoughts would be appreciated.
All the best,
     Peter

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hello JJack users and developers,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Peter Brinkmann has contributed substantial changes to libjjack.c and
</I>&gt;<i> JJackSystem.java. They are a complete re-implementation of the native
</I>&gt;<i> client architecture and promise to solve a number of performance issues.
</I>&gt;<i> I have not done any practical tests yet, but looked into the code and
</I>&gt;<i> have found several useful improvements (see the list of changes below).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Peter's code is available on an SVN-branch at
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://&lt;developername">https://&lt;developername</A> &lt;<A HREF="https://%3cdevelopername/">https://%3cdevelopername/</A>&gt;&gt;@svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/jjack/branches/v04-proposal
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Changed files:
</I>&gt;<i> src/de/gulden/framework/jjack/JJackAudioEvent.java
</I>&gt;<i> src/de/gulden/framework/jjack/JJackNativeClient.java (new)
</I>&gt;<i> src/de/gulden/framework/jjack/JJackNativeClientEvent.java (new)
</I>&gt;<i> src/de/gulden/framework/jjack/JJackNativeClientListener.java (new)
</I>&gt;<i> src/de/gulden/framework/jjack/JJackSystem.java
</I>&gt;<i> src/de/gulden/framework/jjack/libjjack.c
</I>&gt;<i> make/build_macosx.xml (new)
</I>&gt;<i> make/build.xml
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have called this &quot;version 0.4 proposal&quot;. We can discuss including
</I>&gt;<i> other changes (maybe from the Frinika project?) before merging them into
</I>&gt;<i> trunk and finally building a 0.4 release.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> New features are:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - The native bridge now lives in a new class (JJackNativeClient.java),
</I>&gt;<i> which is a minimal wrapper for native jack clients. It is now possible
</I>&gt;<i> to create multiple clients, open, close, etc., without restarting the JVM
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - The process callback is significantly smaller than before, which
</I>&gt;<i> hopefully reduces the amount of zombifications.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - There now is a shutdown call (with listeners), so at least you get
</I>&gt;<i> notified when you are zombified.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Init and destroy now implicitly happen automatically, and in addition
</I>&gt;<i> every client has a finalize-method, so there are no leaks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Despite all changes, JJackSystem should behave exactly like before
</I>&gt;<i> (except the thread-issue mentioned above). Besides JJackSystem.java,
</I>&gt;<i> libjjack.c and a small addition in JJackAudioEvent.java, no files have
</I>&gt;<i> been changed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Inside the process-callback, as few new object instances as possible
</I>&gt;<i> are created.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - There now is a build-file for MacOS.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Feedback on this is very helpful for building a version 0.4 release. So
</I>&gt;<i> everyone is welcome to give comments.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best,
</I>&gt;<i> Jens
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
