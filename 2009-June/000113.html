<PRE>Hi Ollie,

&gt;<i> Hi, this appears to work well for me (Mac OSX 10.5.7, Java 1.5,
</I>&gt;<i> Eclipse 3.4.1, Jack 0.8.7), except for following message (which also
</I>&gt;<i> occurs on my previous version of jjack)...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> jack_client_new: deprecated
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is weird; one of the first things I did was to get rid of the
</I>deprecated jack_client_new calls.  It appears that you're still loading the
old version of the native binaries.  That also seems strange, though,
because the new Java code (JJackNativeClient.java) doesn't work with the old
binaries.  Is it possible that your build path in Eclipse still points to
the old jar file as well as the old native code?  Did you build the new
version with &quot;ant -f build_macosx.xml&quot; in the make directory?  You may also
have to delete the old Mac binaries that come with the svn checkout.

Another question: I don't see a way to query JJackSystem (e.g., to
&gt;<i> find out how many channels or what the buffer size is before you
</I>&gt;<i> embark on this process callback), or to remote control Jack in any way
</I>&gt;<i> (e.g., tell it how many channels / buffer size, make connections, or
</I>&gt;<i> start and stop jackd). Are these things possible?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you're using the original JJack functionality (fully preserved in the
</I>new version), then you can set the number of channels through system
properties.  If you're using the new functionality, then you can open and
close an arbitrary number of Jack clients and specify the number of input
and output ports for each of them; you can also specify the names of clients
to connect to.  JJackNativeClient.java also comes with static methods
that'll report the sample rate and buffer size.

As for starting and stopping Jack, it would be a trivial change to
automatically start Jack when opening a client (just pass an additional flag
to jack_client_open), but for the time being I decided against that because
it would be a bit of a departure from the original functionality of JJack.
Hope this helps,
     Peter
