<PRE>Hi Neil,
I also came up against the singe client limitation, and I reworked JJack so
that it now supports multiple clients.  I also slimmed down the jack process
callback so that you may see a small performance increase.  You can find the
new version at
<A HREF="http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/jjack/branches/v04-proposal.">http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/jjack/branches/v04-proposal.</A>

The original functionality of JJack remains unchanged, but the native bridge
moved into a new class called JJackNativeClient that is a minimal wrapper
for the native code.
Best,
    Peter

PS:  I made a number of changes since I last wrote to this list.  In
particular, I removed the small difference in thread attachment that I
mentioned earlier, so that the original functionality of JJack is now fully
preserved, and I updated the ant buildfile to work for both Mac and Linux.

&gt;<i> Hi All,

</I>&gt;<i> Firstly, a big thank you to those who've put time into developing JJack -
</I>&gt;<i> I've been using JJack happily for a few projects until now.  However on a
</I>&gt;<i> current project I'm working on I was coming across some issues to do with
</I>&gt;<i> the single client limitation, lack of access to the full Jack API and
</I>&gt;<i> deployment problems.  Having been an occasional reader, rather than a
</I>&gt;<i> subscriber, to this list I'd missed some of the recent development
</I>&gt;<i> discussions addressing some of these concerns.  Hopefully this message will
</I>&gt;<i> still be of some interest.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I had decided a while back to experiment with a JNA binding to Jack, and
</I>&gt;<i> finally got around to looking at this yesterday.  I used JNAerator to create
</I>&gt;<i> the majority of the Java interface from the Jack header files, though they
</I>&gt;<i> needed some tweaking by hand and are not feature complete yet - will add
</I>&gt;<i> MIDI and Transport code ASAP - as I concentrated on getting the audio stuff
</I>&gt;<i> working.  Anyway, after a couple of hours of tweaking, I've got some working
</I>&gt;<i> code to access Jack and a simple audio client interface to test this.  I was
</I>&gt;<i> a bit wary that the extra overhead of JNA vs custom JNI might make this
</I>&gt;<i> unfeasible, but am pleasantly surprised by the results.  Have tried it on
</I>&gt;<i> two different Linux setups, one running with a realtime kernel, and it all
</I>&gt;<i> seems to run nicely.  JNA should pick up the Mac and Windows libs
</I>&gt;<i> automatically but it's not something I can test.  I haven't done any real
</I>&gt;<i> benchmarking, but on the realtime kernel machine there appears to be about a
</I>&gt;<i> 3-5% CPU difference above JJack, however this is only an 800MHz tablet
</I>&gt;<i> (Indamixx) so on something with a bit more grunt it should be less
</I>&gt;<i> noticeable.  It also happily runs with RT privileges, without any XRuns.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've put the test code as is up at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/java-audio-utils/">http://code.google.com/p/java-audio-utils/</A>  - bear in mind it's a bit
</I>&gt;<i> untidy and undocumented though! :-)  I have no intention of trying to
</I>&gt;<i> compete with the scope of JJack for this, but will probably look to improve
</I>&gt;<i> it as a bare bones wrapper for my own needs.  However, I wonder if this
</I>&gt;<i> approach might be of interest for future development of JJack - even if not
</I>&gt;<i> for the process callback if the overhead is thought to be too much, it might
</I>&gt;<i> be an easier way of adding full access to the rest of the Jack API.
</I>&gt;<i>
