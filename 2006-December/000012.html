<PRE>Hi, Helge

I think the rate of sampling is handled by the Jack implementation,  
and JJack just intervenes as a client and exposes the bytes fed  
through the Jack system to Java. So some of this sampling rate, and  
the consequent load, will be determined by your configuration of Jack.

 From your description it seems like you have similar requirements to  
the project I attempted. You can see a nice pic from our test  
contraption here...
<A HREF="http://flickr.com/photos/55387465@N00/218307084/">http://flickr.com/photos/55387465@N00/218307084/</A>

I made some progress on it, and managed to get quite a few usb audio  
cards working with JJack - initially on Pure:Dyne had driver problems  
but finally on debian got at least the test JJack apps like the  
'echo' working for long periods with multiple (4 in the end) cheap  
VoIP soundcards and USB hubs. I think in principle the experiment  
could have been extended to more soundcards and hubs. The sample apps  
would crash eventually (after quite a while - tens of minutes) but  
could be restarted automatically with simple scripting. I needed to  
work on something else at that point, so it got left as it is.

You'll see more in the links below. In the longer run I intended to  
simply serialise the bytes in JJack events directly to file, and  
reverse the process for playback. Doesn't give you the open format  
which might be ideal, but for my project the playback output was  
JJack as well, (other live sound outputs)  so it suited me to try it  
that way. Funnily enough my project involved telephones too.

You can follow the blog topics about the project in reverse order  
here...

...and several snapshots from the attempted code framework by  
following these links...

1) The primary game intended to be run using a multi-audio-channel  
enabled PC
<A HREF="http://curiosity.cvs.sourceforge.net/curiosity/phoney/com/cefn/">http://curiosity.cvs.sourceforge.net/curiosity/phoney/com/cefn/</A> 
backchatter/games/ConverseGame.java?view=markup

2) A directory containing test 'games' which invoke my Channel- 
oriented API

backchatter/games/

3) Here you can browse my Channel API itself - a high level framework  
for manipulating, wiring and recording channels in general.
<A HREF="http://curiosity.cvs.sourceforge.net/curiosity/phoney/com/cefn/">http://curiosity.cvs.sourceforge.net/curiosity/phoney/com/cefn/</A>

4) A rough and ready JJack implementation of my channel API
<A HREF="http://curiosity.cvs.sourceforge.net/curiosity/phoney/com/cefn/">http://curiosity.cvs.sourceforge.net/curiosity/phoney/com/cefn/</A> 
backchatter/impl/jjack/

The API seemed to work. The channel-based games written (like the  
ConverseGame) would run with a text emulator (text input and output  
channels were coordinated properly).

However, the JJack implementation hosting multiple live audio channel  
interfaces was still very untried and tested. Mostly I would look at  
my own use of JJack for reference and ideas rather than as a working  
implementation. I still intend to build on it in the end, but it's  
work in progress.

Drop me a line (directly or through this list) if you're following  
any of the same paths to try and get your thing working, and if I can  
help I'll make suggestions. Not totally sure what your application  
is, but I'm guessing it's similar in it's basic needs.

Good luck.
