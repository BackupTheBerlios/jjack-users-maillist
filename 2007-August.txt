Hello!

I'm trying to run the sample program JJackMixerProviderTest with this
library path

-Djava.library.path=/home/helge/devel/jjack/lib/i386/Linux

where the libjjack.so resides

Exception in thread "main" javax.sound.sampled.LineUnavailableException:
Audio Device Unavailable
    at com.sun.media.sound.HeadspaceMixer.nResume(Native Method)
    at com.sun.media.sound.HeadspaceMixer.implOpen(HeadspaceMixer.java:346)

    at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:597)
    at com.intellij.rt.execution.application.AppMain.main(AppMain.java:90)

It seems like in the example, the infos from

Info[] infos = AudioSystem.getMixerInfo();

do not contain the desired JJack info necessary to initialize. Probably
something I have to do to get the JJack system registered as a valid
JavaSound mixer?

Moreover, if the jackd happens not to be running, the jre crashes:

Hi,

If you look at de.gulden.framework.jjack.JJackSystem :

        try
        {
            // try loading native library from system lib (library path)
            System.loadLibrary("jjack");
        } catch(Throwable e)
        {
            // Else look in the local lib folder
            File file = new File("lib/"+System.getProperty("os.arch
")+"/"+System.getProperty("os.name")+"/libjjack.so");
            String libJJackFileName = file.getAbsolutePath();
            System.load(libJJackFileName);
        }

You see that you really don't have to set any library path.

If you do so (as you've done), you must make sure that it's the correct one
compiled for your platform. The current cvs only contains a 64 bit binary -
and if you're using 32 bit you have to build this yourself (but it's as
simple as running the all target of the ant build script).

cheers,

Peter

OK, if working dir is set to the  jjack home directory...

I don't think there were any  binary included in the cvs repo.  The ant
script build.xml contained a target for making this libjjack.so, which I
built together with the jjack jars. So I think that there shouldn't be any
problems with the binary.

After a bit more testing, it turns out that the my problem was related to
how you automatically set up JJackMixerProvider via the setup in
META-INF/services which were picked up by the JavaSound AudioSystem when
launched via the jar files, but which my dear IntelliJ system could not
detect.

Thus, when running it from the IDE, I need to call the JJackMixerProvider
directly, not via calls to the AudioSystem. then everything works smoothly.

However, I have more questions.

1) When trying to grab from the lines opened, my code just hangs in this
loop:

        while (true) {
            lineIn.read(buf, 0, buf.length);
            lineOut.write(buf, 0, buf.length);
            noise.write(buf, 0, buf.length);
        }

I have tried to start the jackd deamon with 44100 samle rate (default being
48000), and forcing short as sample size, with no luck. Also, I have tried
to use qjackctl to connect JJack input/output to the alsa playback and
capture also with no luck.

2) I would like to use jjack for mixing other sounds in together with voice
being tranfered from the network. I had expected to see more jjack clients
popping up when executing

       SourceDataLine noise = (SourceDataLine)mixer.getLine(
mixer.getSourceLineInfo()[0]);
        noise.open(format, 512);
        noise.start();

but this was not the case. When I insert two different sounds into the two
different SourceDataLines available, where is the mixing taking place? Would
this mixing be "latency-free" like the rest of the jack system? If it is
necessary to install more than one jjack client to utilize the real-time
jack mixing capabilities, is that available in the same process, or do I
need to lauch several jvm's?

Helge Fredriksen

I'm not sure if I understand what you mean  that your code hangs - this is a
forever loop - and it surely won't stop, but the expected result should be
that the jjack-clients input is sent to the output. The noise dataline, what
does this do?

 You can open more than two ports using the ports environment variable:

http://jjack.berlios.de/jjack.html#mozTocId628724

If I understand you correct, you want to use the jack patching mechanism for
connecting signals (mixing)? Otherwise I would recommend that do the mixing
internally in your application (before writing to lineOut).

Bad example, anyway the execution seems to be hanging on

lineIn.read(buf, 0, buf.length);

and also

lineOut.write(buf, 0, buf.length);

Thus, I'm not able to get any data through on my lines, even if I have a
valid connection towards xmms producing sound for me.

Message-ID: <e78383b30708290818n1f7f0af2j621645a1a52a4768@mail.gmail.com>

Hello!

I've been testing JJack with a modified JJackMixerProviderTest class:

        Info jackMixerInfo = null;

        JJackMixerProvider provider = new JJackMixerProvider();
        Info[] infos = provider.getMixerInfo();

        System.out.println("length: " + infos.length);
        for (int i = 0; i < infos.length; i++) {
            Info info = infos[i];
            if (info.getName().equals("JJack")) {
                jackMixerInfo = info;
            }
        }
        AudioFormat format = new AudioFormat(JJackSystem.getSampleRate(),
16, 1, true, false);

        Mixer mixer = provider.getMixer(jackMixerInfo);

        SourceDataLine lineOut = (SourceDataLine) mixer.getLine(
mixer.getSourceLineInfo()[0]);
        if (lineOut instanceof SourceJJackLine) {
            System.out.println("yes");
        }
        lineOut.open(format);
        lineOut.start();

        TargetDataLine lineIn = (TargetDataLine) mixer.getLine(
mixer.getTargetLineInfo()[0]);
        lineIn.open(format);
        lineIn.start();

        byte[] buf = new byte[256];
        while (true) {
            lineIn.read(buf, 0, buf.length);
            lineOut.write(buf, 0, buf.length);
        }

I have the following problem:

lineIn.read() seems to do it's job, grabbing nicely those 256 frames.
However, nothing appear to be written to lineOut. Now, debugging a bit
closer, I end up finding that

    boolean canReadFloat(int length) {
        return fifo.availableRead() >= length*2;
    }

in SourceJJackLine always returns false, and thus this code

            if (line.canReadFloat(length)) {
                float[] lineBuffer = line.readFloat(length);
                for (int n = 0; n < length; n++) {
                    System.out.println("line output: " + (n % channels) +
channelIndex);
                    System.out.println("channels: " + channels);

                    e.getOutputs()[(n % channels) + channelIndex].put((n /
channels), lineBuffer[n]);
                }
            }

in JJackMixer's process routine never get's executed.

Why the length*2 in canReadFloat()?

Actually, after investigating a bit further, I get these stacks when I do a

try() {
} catch()

around the process() block  in JJackMixer which is called by native code:

java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 512

Hello!

I've been testing JJack with a modified JJackMixerProviderTest class:

        Info jackMixerInfo = null;

        JJackMixerProvider provider = new JJackMixerProvider();
        Info[] infos = provider.getMixerInfo();

        System.out.println("length: " + infos.length);
        for (int i = 0; i < infos.length; i++) {
            Info info = infos[i];
            if (info.getName().equals("JJack")) {
                jackMixerInfo = info;
            }
        }
        AudioFormat format = new AudioFormat(JJackSystem.getSampleRate(),
16, 1, true, false);

        Mixer mixer = provider.getMixer(jackMixerInfo);

        SourceDataLine lineOut = (SourceDataLine) mixer.getLine(
mixer.getSourceLineInfo()[0]);
        if (lineOut instanceof SourceJJackLine) {
            System.out.println("yes");
        }
        lineOut.open(format);
        lineOut.start();

        TargetDataLine lineIn = (TargetDataLine) mixer.getLine(
mixer.getTargetLineInfo()[0]);
        lineIn.open(format);
        lineIn.start();

        byte[] buf = new byte[256];
        while (true) {
            lineIn.read(buf, 0, buf.length);
            lineOut.write(buf, 0, buf.length);
        }

I have the following problem:

lineIn.read() seems to do it's job, grabbing nicely those 256 frames.
However, nothing appear to be written to lineOut. Now, debugging a bit
closer, I end up finding that

    boolean canReadFloat(int length) {
        return fifo.availableRead() >= length*2;
    }

in SourceJJackLine always returns false, and thus this code

            if (line.canReadFloat(length)) {
                float[] lineBuffer = line.readFloat(length);
                for (int n = 0; n < length; n++) {
                    System.out.println("line output: " + (n % channels) +
channelIndex);
                    System.out.println ("channels: " + channels);

                    e.getOutputs()[(n % channels) + channelIndex].put((n /
channels), lineBuffer[n]);
                }
            }

in JJackMixer's process routine never get's executed.

Why the length*2 in canReadFloat()?

Helge Fredriksen

Sorry, I messed it up... Some test code hanging around in there which
triggered it. It's working perfectly now...

Thanks for a nice API, anyway!
