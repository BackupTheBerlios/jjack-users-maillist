<PRE>Hi Jens,

I never tried using USB devices - but your observations of javasound latency 
improvements starting from java 1.5, is the same as mine (you have to use the 
ALSA or WDM driver though - the old javasound engine is still slow).

Your measurements are quite the same as I've observed (for the onboard 
soundcards). Also the difference in results with linux and windows (much 
higher latency on windows) is the same as I've observed.

I have never tried this roundrip measurement using ethernet - only the full 
duplex approach as used in Frinika. I get to calculate the full roundrip 
time, and may also estimate the system overhead (by subtracting the buffer 
latency time) - but to separate input / output system overhead is more 
difficult...

cheers,

Peter

</I>&gt;<i> Thanks again for the hint. I used this piece of code as an entry point for

</I>&gt;<i> add more latency through the recording/measuring machine, but that's ok as
</I>&gt;<i> long as your aim is comparing different setups and not getting absolute
</I>&gt;<i> values.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> General question: Is my approach valid? More details below.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The two most surprising results are:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) there's a dramatic improve of JavaSound both on Linux and Windows since
</I>&gt;<i> jdk 1.5 (the horror-stories on 200ms latency have obviously been true in
</I>&gt;<i> times of jdk1.4, but it has improved a lot)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) JavaSound seems to be more liable to different hardware and
</I>&gt;<i> system-configurations: JACK/JJack behaves more stable with respect to
</I>&gt;<i> providing equal latency for different underlying hardware, while JavaSound
</I>&gt;<i> sometimes succeeds in achieving very low latency with the tested
</I>&gt;<i> onboard-audio-hardware (Intel 82801), but falls behind the use of JJack
</I>&gt;<i> when the tested USB-audio-hardware (Aardvark DirectUSB) is deployed.
</I>&gt;<i> Depeding on the Linux configuration, there had been high differences in
</I>&gt;<i> latency when using the USB-audio-device.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A table with results is attached as PDF.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've added the benchmark tool to JJack's CVS-repository, class
</I>&gt;<i> de.gulden.framework.jjack.util.benchmark.AudioBenchmark.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> More details:
</I>&gt;<i> Machine A is a Pentium M 1400MHz, using either the onboard-sound-card
</I>&gt;<i> (Intel 82801) or an external USB-audio-interface (Aardvark DirectMix USB3).
</I>&gt;<i> The latency of this setup is being measured each under a Linux
</I>&gt;<i> 2.6.15-non-realtime kernel, a 2.6.15-4-realtime kernel, and Windows XP. All
</I>&gt;<i> three JDK versions 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6 get utilized, each one in combination
</I>&gt;<i> which each device and each operating system either using JJack (on Linux)
</I>&gt;<i> or JavaSound output. Machine B is a AMD 800Mhz running a 2.6.15-4-realtime
</I>&gt;<i> Linux (Musix 0.39) and JDK 1.5, this second machine performs the measuring
</I>&gt;<i> by recording and subsequently analyzing the audio signal generated by
</I>&gt;<i> machine A in all different setups. Both machines have been connected via
</I>&gt;<i> ethernet, using a direct-link cable (a &#8222;crossed&#8220; ethernet cable) which
</I>&gt;<i> minimizes network latency by avoiding any hubs or ip-switches on the way
</I>&gt;<i> between the machines. The ICMP-ping times reported by the &#8222;ping&#8220;-command
</I>&gt;<i> result in 0.2 ms and less, so network-transmission latency does not
</I>&gt;<i> significantly distort the measured results. The audio-output of machine A
</I>&gt;<i> is connected to the audio input of machine B via an analog (zero-latency
</I>&gt;<i> .-) cable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the software-side, a benchmark application has been written that either
</I>&gt;<i> runs in server-mode on the machine of which the audio-latency is to be
</I>&gt;<i> measured (machine A), or in client-mode on the machine which performs the
</I>&gt;<i> measuring (machine B). The benchmark application has been made part of the
</I>&gt;<i> JJack package (available via CVS), in class
</I>&gt;<i> de.gulden.framework.jjack.util.benchmark.AudioBenchmark. When run in server
</I>&gt;<i> mode, the program first initializes the required audio-output device
</I>&gt;<i> (either via JJack or JavaSound), and then puts itself to sleep by waiting
</I>&gt;<i> on a UDP network data-package to arrive on port 7777. Once this UDP-package
</I>&gt;<i> has been received, the program immediately outputs 100 ms of a
</I>&gt;<i> full-amplitude square signal with an period length of 100 frames. Reacting
</I>&gt;<i> on the UDP-package has been implemented to happen as soon as possible, both
</I>&gt;<i> in JJack and JavaSound mode, although the ways of achieving the lowest
</I>&gt;<i> possible reaction time fudamentally differ in JJack and JavaSound due to
</I>&gt;<i> the principle difference of a pull-architecture in JACK/JJack and a
</I>&gt;<i> push-architecture in JavaSound. Once the audio output has been generate,
</I>&gt;<i> the program waits 100 ms and loops back to waiting for an UDP-package until
</I>&gt;<i> it gets manually stopped.
</I>&gt;<i> When running in client mode, the program initializes audio-input via JJack
</I>&gt;<i> and starts recording of one second, then waits 100 ms, issues a UDP-package
</I>&gt;<i> to port 7777 on the server machine and remembers the amount of empty audio
</I>&gt;<i> data recorded until the UDP-packge has been sent, waits until the record
</I>&gt;<i> buffer is filled, cuts off the beginning part recorded before the
</I>&gt;<i> UDP-package was actually sent, and then searches the recorded audio for the
</I>&gt;<i> occurrence of a sequence of at least 10 amplitude values above 0.2, which
</I>&gt;<i> is interpreted as the beginning of the received square waveform signal. The
</I>&gt;<i> time of &#8222;empty&#8220; audio data until the waveform begins is calculated and
</I>&gt;<i> output as latency time. Note that this way of measuring of course also
</I>&gt;<i> includes latency induced by other origins (e.g. little network overhead,
</I>&gt;<i> which, however, can be considered less with the UDP-ping method than with
</I>&gt;<i> any custom Midi-device in a real-world realtime-audio application) and of
</I>&gt;<i> course the latency of the recording audio-input on the client machine.
</I>&gt;<i> However, the method appears suitable for comparing different combinatios of
</I>&gt;<i> audio APIs, Java versions, operating systems and hardware to get
</I>&gt;<i> information on how they relatively compare to each other.
</I>&gt;<i> The JACK server has been run in playback-only mode on the server, and in
</I>&gt;<i> capture-only mode on the client. Duplex-mode has not been measured.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, what do you think, are the results plausible? Thanks for comments,
</I>&gt;<i> Jens

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; several people have reported big differences in latency between using

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is there an easy way to measure the latency of JavaSound (some piece of

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm very thankful for hints.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What other fundamental differences between JavaSound and JJack are there?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (I'm currently writing a paper about JJack for the Linux Audio Conference
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; LAC '07. The paper is already accepted as a contribution to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; conference, and now I want to improve it by adding benchmarks comparing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; JavaSound and JJack. I'll make a post to this list when the paper is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; available.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Many thanks in advance,
