This is partly correct. It depends on what driver you're using. Javasound can 
either use it's own java sound engine- which adds lot's of latency. On some 
platforms and VM's this sound engine is the only option.

On Linux or Windows Javasound is able to go directly to ALSA or WDM - meaning 
that you obtain the same latency as native stuff. Using ALSA it's no problem 
to get a latency as low as 5 ms, just using javasound. With WDM on windows it 
depends on the driver , if it's a KERNEL-STREAMING driver you can obtain very 
low latencies. Else windows os will add it's 30 ms Kernel mixer latency.

The only problem with low latencies in javasound is realtime priority. Since 
you're not able to schedule realtime events for writing to the audio device, 
your audio might be unstable on low latencies.

We have a test benchmark program we used for this in 
com.frinika.audio.benchmark.RecordInputRoundtripLatencyTest - that sends a 
signal out and records it back and measures the delay... Might maybe be a bit 
tricky to set up. 

&gt;<i> What other fundamental differences between JavaSound and JJack are there?
</I>
Basically the API is very different. E.g. JJack reflects the jack api which 
float based, but javasound lines are pcm byte oriented.

Another major is that javasound doesn't support realtime scheduling, while 
jjack supports this through the jack realtime feature.
