Hello,

Jens Gulden a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> several people have reported big differences in latency between using JavaSound and JJack. JavaSound 
</I>&gt;<i> seems to regularly cause latency of about 200ms.
</I>
I can report better performance with JavaSound using Direct Device
driver (which directly hold on ALSA) than with JJack (which adds the
extra layer of Jack) either for capture or playback. You can go down to
an overall latency (input to output) of 2 or 3 ms.

But, as told Peter, the real advantage of JJack is that it use the
thread priority of the real-time process thread of Jack.

In Java SE, there is no mean to get real-time priority for a user
thread. But if you use JNI, you can switch the pthread priority of your
Java thread.

&gt;<i> What other fundamental differences between JavaSound and JJack are there?
</I>
Jack inherent difference is that you can connect any Jack client as you
wish, whereas once an application holds the ALSA device no other app can
push sound to it.

Also, as said Peter, Jack client only matters samples as float, so you
don't have to bother with dithering and al, which is very pratical as a
developer.

Apart from that, JJack adds lots of stuff above Jack, that i find
displaced; a channel API; a GUI framework... All those stuff should be
moved in another library!

&gt;<i> (I'm currently writing a paper about JJack for the Linux Audio Conference LAC '07. The paper is 
</I>&gt;<i> already accepted as a contribution to the conference, and now I want to improve it by adding 
</I>&gt;<i> benchmarks comparing JavaSound and JJack. I'll make a post to this list when the paper is available.)
</I>
That is great. Maybe audio with Java could be better considered!
You've got all my support! :)
