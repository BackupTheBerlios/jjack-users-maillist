<PRE>&gt;<i> I can report better performance with JavaSound using Direct Device
</I>&gt;<i> driver (which directly hold on ALSA) than with JJack (which adds the
</I>&gt;<i> extra layer of Jack) either for capture or playback. You can go down to
</I>&gt;<i> an overall latency (input to output) of 2 or 3 ms.
</I>
OK, upon reporting the latency experience with JavaSound, I was mostly
referring to the Windows platform which we experienced great
improvement with when using a JNI driver for the sound recording part.
Sound playback worked OK with standard JavaSound.

&gt;<i> Jack inherent difference is that you can connect any Jack client as you
</I>&gt;<i> wish, whereas once an application holds the ALSA device no other app can
</I>&gt;<i> push sound to it.
</I>
Yes, this is exactly what frustrates me right now. We are trying to
write a sound recording device using JavaSound on Linux, but capturing
sound is not trivial since we experience spurious blocking. We had
hoped that ALSA had matured with software mixing so that several
devices could access the device, but this is not the case. It seems
that we cannot use a standard Ubuntu/Suse desktop for our app, since
various gstreamer stuff reject us from accessing the sound hardware.

If anyone has some suggestions on how to best resolve this problem, we
would greatly appreciate it! I have tried using lsof | grep alsa to
get an overview of all processes using alsa, but this seems not to
give me the whole story.

&gt;<i> Also, as said Peter, Jack client only matters samples as float, so you
</I>&gt;<i> don't have to bother with dithering and al, which is very pratical as a
</I>&gt;<i> developer.
</I>
When we occationaly get access to the sound device, we do hear clicks
and some sort of jitters when capturing sound.

Best regards,
Helge Fredriksen
