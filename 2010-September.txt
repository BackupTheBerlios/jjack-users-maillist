Subject: [jjack-users] need a little help... making sound using JJack
Message-ID: <AANLkTimTH2hT9shCe3uN-O_GDQphEmZzhcmDx1DK9rxw@mail.gmail.com>

So, I want to make a .wav player using Java.  The program I'm updating is in
Java and currently plays the .wav file using javax.sound api.  Another
program in the system plays audio using Jack C calls.  The Jack C program
seems to "lock" something, such that when it is running, the Java program
cannot play audio. The thought is that if I change the Java program to play
audio using JJack, it will go thru Jackd, and the two programs will be able
to run, and play, audio simultaneously. Am I on the right track?

Well, how to do this in JJack is unclear to me. Do I need to simply create a
JJackClient with a process() method? If so, that didn't work for me.  Tried
using JJackPlayer too, just to make some noise. While it compiled and ran, I
didn't get any sound.

Below are two classes that I was trying to use as a toy to understand JJack.
They compile, but don't produce any sound.  I'm hoping someone can tell me
how to write to jackd using jjack. At first, I'm hoping just to get to noise
(that's why I made the random data). Once I get some noise, then I will read
the wav file and push the data to jjackd in the same manner.  Well,
hopefully the same. The wav data is 16 bit data at a sample rate of 8k. Not
sure how to convert that to the float data that jjack uses.

Thanks, Kieth

OK

When running, JACK tends to take full control over the ALSA sound card, 
preventing other applications from accessing it.

Yes. There are a couple of other ways to route audio through JACK, but using
JJack could be a suitable way to do it.

My JJack is rather rusty. Does your application, when run, show up in the
'connections' window of qjackctl? Is it connected to your soundcard?

I just installed qjackctl, but it has a problem when it runs. Due to C++
name mangling i can't tell which library it's missing. I think it's
drawPixmap?

Which distro are you using?

Could you paste the error message you're getting?

At work, we are using Fedora 10 32 bit.

Yes, will do this tomorrow.

At home, I'm using Fedora 13, 64 bit. I am able to run qjackctl.  When i run
the Java app, the connections window does show 2 input ports for JJack and 2
output ports for JJack. But am unsure what calls to make to send data to
JJack input port. and how to connect JJack output to sound card.

Are you installing qjackctl through the package manager or 'manually'? 
Normally the package manager should take care of installing all neccessary
libraries.

You don't need to use the JJack input ports if your application doesn't 
require sound input.

You can connect JJack output to the sound card in the 'connections' window:
just select JJack on the left and your soundcard (usually called 'alsa_pcm' 
or something like that iirc) on the right, and hit 'connect' (or use 
drag-and-drop).

Agreed. I did use rpm to install qjackctl, with no dependency complaints.
Which confused me when I couldn't run it at work.

Well, I guess that's good if I can connect using qjackctl. But that's not a
good solution. I need to connect programatically. And push data to something
in JJack (the output ports?) which isn't obvious to me.

So, it was staring me in the face all along. I simply need to implement the
process() method in JJackClient. And ignore the input port.

It's still unclear how to take my wav data (16 bit, 8000 samples) and put it
into the relevant float values. Ideas?
