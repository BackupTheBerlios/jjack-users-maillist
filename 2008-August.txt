Hello Chris,

This is something still missing in the JJack API. The current version 
focuses on the functionality required to provide audio i/o, however, any 
'management' functionality such as port-connecting etc. is not provided. 
Maybe it is not too hard for you to add some wrapper code in 
JJackSystem.java and libjjack.c yourself, if you find operations in the 
native JACK API that do what you want. (If you do so, it would be great 
if you shared the results to jjack-users at lists.berlios.de.)

Have you been successful in calling jack_connect as a shell-process? 
It's quite a heavyweight solution, though...

Best,
Jens
