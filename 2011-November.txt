Subject: [jjack-users] Small v04-proposal patch
Message-ID: <CAHCOHQnLM2TbVdiZsc5+oAY9vH7HyAFUGy-xgEeTCWFPF-BH9g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm looking at what it would take to get jReality into the Fedora
Linux distribution, and so am chasing down dependencies.  I see that
jReality is using the v04-proposal branch, rather than the released
version 0.3.  While building that branch, the C compiler emitted some
warnings due to missing "const"s.  In jjack-update.patch, attached, I
fixed this and also threw in some "static"s for good measure.

Also, in "jjack-javadoc.patch", attached, two kinds of javadoc
problems are fixed.  First, @Override is an annotation, not a javadoc
tag.  Second, there shouldn't be a colon on a @param line, as javadoc
thinks the colon is part of the parameter name.

Are there any plans to release the v04-proposal branch as 0.4?

Regards,

Hi Jerry,
I haven't seen any activity around JJack in a long time, and so I went
ahead and extracted the parts that I want for my work, refactored them
a little, and posted them at Gitorious.  You can find it here:
https://www.gitorious.org/pdlib

jReality needs to be updated, and I'm hoping to find the time to do that soon.
Cheers,
     Peter

Okay, I'll wait for a bit, then.  Would you mind dropping me a line
when the refactoring has been done?  Thanks,

I too got frustrated with the lack of activity around here a while
back, but actually ended up writing a whole new binding - JNAJack,
part of JAudioLibs at http://code.google.com/p/java-audio-utils/.
While it feels a little wrong to be promoting another project on here,
the reason I bring it up is that it would be possible to write a
binary compatible version of JJack that used JNAJack under the covers
- JNAJack is meant as a direct translation of the Jack API to Java.
Use of JNA also means no additional native libraries are required, and
it works across Windows, Mac and Linux.  JNA is already in Fedora as
well I believe.

Just a thought.  Don't know if that's of interest to anyone around
here?  Otherwise, sorry for intruding on this thread.

Best wishes,

Neil

Hi Neil,

> JNAJack, part of JAudioLibs at http://code.google.com/p/java-audio-utils/

It is perfectly ok to point to alternative approaches here, or to 
mention projects, that branched from JJack. If it ends up in better Java 
support for JACK, it's fine.

Best, Jens
