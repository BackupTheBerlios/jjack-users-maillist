Subject: [jjack-users] Controlling master volume
Message-ID: <e78383b30706060634w486f9c80lda88c09de0f4d05b@mail.gmail.com>

Hello!

I'm using JavaSound (soon in combination with JJack) and I'm wondering if
it's possible somehow to control the master gain on the ALSA device, mic and
speaker separately (or Microsoft audio device) itself using some kind call
via JavaSound or similar. It seems like getting the lines from the mixer and
query for controls like this:

mixer.getControl(FloatControl.Type.VOLUME) or
line.getControl(FloatControl.Type.VOLUME)

gives little success on Linux at least.

Any ideas?

Regards,
Helge Fredriksen

Hi,

Since this is a pure javasound related question, I'm sure you'll get an answer 
if you post to:

JAVASOUND-INTEREST at java.sun.com

Regards,

Peter

I assume the first thing to do is compile everything myself, but just in
case...

...is there any obvious fix for the following problem, seen when using
JJack as built for Suse 10.2 (dowloaded from the "packman" respository):

Hello Andrew,

it looks like you are running a 64 bit system. There is at least one known bug in version 0.2 which 
can make JJack refuse to run on 64 bit systems (size of INF pointer). This has been fixed in the 
meantime, but is only available via CVS by now.

So, yes, please try to compile everything yourself, and be sure to use the most current code from CVS 
(see http://developer.berlios.de/cvs/?group_id=1786). Besides fixing the 64 bit bug there have been 
MANY improvements to JJack since version 0.2, because other developers have joined in. (I myself 
didn't have time yet to try out all the new things, but expect JJack on CVS to look already pretty 
different than release 0.2.)

Btw., JJack 0.2 also runs unstable on "normal" 32 bit Intel machines, I got such SIGSEGV crashes 
also quite often when performing benchmark tests recently. I expect the current CVS code to also be 
more stable on 32 bit machines.

Hope that helps,
Jens

Thanks.  The CVS head compiled and runs fine (both the demo code and my
own initial attempt at a client).

Cheers,
Andrew
