Hallo,

that+s fine to hear that JJack is used. I have made some tests using it 
directly without JavaSound-bridge. But I run into problem with single core 
older PCs. I am not sure but I think the garbage collector can be the problem. 
I get breaks in the audio. 

Does anybody knows if the priority of the audiothread which invokes via JNI 
the Java code is attached to the priority to the priority of the attached 
thread executing the JNI-callback?

Does anybody knows if the new gc from Java 7 which can be configured to a 
maximum break the gc stops the world can solve gc affected breaks? This gc 
should be backported also to Java 6?

Does anybody has experiences with JJack based on windows kernelstreaming 
portaudio impl?

best regards
Oliver

Hello everybody,
I made a few more changes to the native client API.  In particular,
connection management is now more flexible than before; you can connect or
disconnect entire ranges of ports at any time.  The original functionality
of JJACK remains unchanged, but a few methods in JJackNativeClient.java have
changed.  I believe that the new API factors things more cleanly than the
previous version; if you prefer the previous version, please let me know.
Best,
     Peter
