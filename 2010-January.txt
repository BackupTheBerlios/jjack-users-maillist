Dear Mac OS X JJackers,

I've been using JJack in a long-distance collaboration. My  
collaborator is running my Java audio app on his MacBook Pro (Core 2  
Duo running Leopard and Java 6). He has the latest Jack installed. The  
app will also have to run on a couple of other Macs which might have  
slightly different specs.

I keep running into the same old problem. I send him a Java 6 compiled  
version of jjack.jar with a universal binary compiled version of  
libjjack.jnilib. I built these myself by modifying the jjack build  
file so that the target Java is 1.6 and the gcc command for the OS X  
native library includes both i386 and x86_64 architectures. I am  
putting jjack.jar and libjjack.jnilib into a single directory called  
lib which I make sure is in my Java classpath and also the Java native  
library path.

For example, I have...

myProject.jar
lib/jjack.jar
lib/libjjack.jnilib

Then I run the program with...

java -jar -cp lib/jjack.jar -Djava.library.path=lib myProject.jar

This works fine on my machine (Core 2 Duo running SnowLeopard and Java  
6), but not on his.

Can anybody tell me what I can be doing to GUARANTEE that when I send  
him a zip file with a script in it it will run on his machine? The  
JJack library seems to adopt a perfectly sensible rule for finding the  
native library. The jnilib appears to be universal binary, and on my  
system this is sufficient to ensure that the library is found. Is  
there a difference in the way different Java versions do the loading?  
Is System.loadLibrary("jjack"), combined with -Djava.library.path=lib  
enough to ensure I find libjjack.jnilib?

Could the 64-bit-ness of Snow Leopard versus the 32-bit-ness of  
Leopard be the problem?

On a related note, typing "arch" on my machine gives me i386, but  
System.getProperty("os.arch") in Java returns x86_64.

Apologies if this goes beyond the realm of a JJack question into  
general JNI problems. Any help would be much appreciated though. It  
might be that the build file could be modified to get a more  
idiotproof library.

Cheers,

Ollie Bown

Hello again,

I thought I should simplify my last post, give it a proper title and actually explain what the error is (it was a late night)...

I am consistently getting the error:

Could not load jjack native library
Tried system library path and /Users/anthonyrowe/Desktop/Kineticatests/squidgrid040110/installation/lib/x86_64/Mac OS X/libjjack.so
java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: /Library/Java/Extensions/libjjack.jnilib: 
	at java.lang.ClassLoader$NativeLibrary.load(Native Method)
	at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadLibrary0(ClassLoader.java:1822)
	at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadLibrary(ClassLoader.java:1715)
	...

As you can see, libjjack.jnilib has been successfully spotted in the System library path. Otherwise, there would be a slightly different error saying "no jjack in java.library.path". Also, I note that if the jnilib is compiled for the wrong architecture you get another slightly different error with the message "no matching architecture in universal wrapper". 

I'm getting neither of these problems, and I'm 110% sure that libjjack is being found (as evidenced above). 

I think this means that the UnsatisfiedLinkError must be to do with how libjjack connects to libjack. I'm not that keen on fixing errors in native code. Can anyone tell me what parameters I need to consider to work out what's wrong? Is this something that JJack could report more clearly?

Was that any clearer?

Many thanks!

Ollie

Hi Ollie,
Quick question:  Are you using the current official version of JJack or the
newish branch, v0.4-proposal?

Actually, I don't think libjjack.jnilib has been spotted.  The first two
lines are the message that you get when JJack can't find the native binary,
and according to your other email, libjjack.jnilib is not in
/Library/Java/Extensions.

Here's my first guess as to what's going on:  Since you compiled your code
on Snow Leopard, there may be some compatibility issue with Leopard.  Delete
or move your file lib/libjjack.jnilib and see whether you get a different
error message.  If so, then that's an indication that Java sees your file
but doesn't like the binary from Snow Leopard.  Rebuilding JJack under
Leopard may solve the problem.

Please let me know how it goes.  This is potentially relevant to a project
of mine as well, but so far nobody on our team has made the switch to Snow
Leopard.
Best,
     Peter

Hi Peter,

I've had various flavours of the problem with different JJacks. I did try the official v0.3 compiled version too. I've also tried using the -Djava.library.path flag AS WELL AS putting libjjack.jnilib in /Library/Java/Extensions. 

Regarding your suggestion, when you completely remove libjjack.jnilib, the UnsatisfiedLinkError is followed with "no jjack in java.library.path" whereas when libjjack.jnilib exists and is somewhere in the native library path the UnsatisfiedLinkError correctly reports the location of the file, as below, and in this case too...

Could not load jjack native library
Tried system library path and /Users/anthonyrowe/Desktop/Kinetica tests/squidgrid 040110/installation/lib/x86_64/Mac OS X/libjjack.so
java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: /Users/anthonyrowe/Desktop/Kinetica tests/squidgrid 040110/installation/lib/libjjack.jnilib:

	at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadLibrary(ClassLoader.java:1739)
	at java.lang.Runtime.loadLibrary0(Runtime.java:823)
	...

I think I've spotted the problem actually, but still don't get it. In Ant's case he's getting the following...

I thought this was harmless junk coming from jackdmp (I get some messages like this on my machine), but I just noticed it's coming from Java, and referring to JackRouter plugin. Sounds bad. Do you think this could be it? 

I'm not able to test any of this directly because I don't have a machine running Leopard myself, my collaborator is in the diametrically opposite time zone to me, which is making the debugging process rather painful! But I'll get him to try different installs of Jack.

That part looks like trouble.  I just looked at the Jack OS X download page,
and I noticed that they have 32-bit binaries for Leopard, and 64-bit
binaries for Snow Leopard only.  If JJack was compiled for 64-bit under Snow
Leopard, then that may cause trouble for Leopard.  I would just rebuild
everything (both Jack and JJack) under Leopard and hope that that'll solve
the problem.
Good luck,
     Peter

Cheers Peter,

I'm going on a short holiday. I'll let you know how this works when I'm back. 

Hopefully it will be possible to get JJack building standard UBs and reporting these linking errors with more accurate detail on OS X as I've become REALLY dependent on it recently, but I'm always finding it behaving differently on different systems and confusing the hell out of me. I'd be glad to help on this front. 

I'm not saying it's not my stupidity that's to blame! But there's nothing wrong with a bit more idiot-proofing.

Anyway, hooray for JJack. Without it, JavaSound would be very boring on OS X.

Hello again.

problem solved. Apologies if the following is obvious, but it will probably be helpful to someone.

Modern Macs are 64 bit machines, but Mac OS has continued to be 32 bit up to and including Leopard. Snow Leopard is 64 bit. This is all well known. 

What is less obvious is that 64-bit Java 6 causes the system to search for 64 bit native libraries, even when running on Leopard, and you need 64-bit libraries all the way down. i.e., you need 64-bit libjjack.jnilib, and you need 64-bit jack installed. Therefore, the advice given on the Jack download page to Mac users is slightly problematic as far as JJack is concerned. Leopard users who download the 32-bit only version and then try to run JJack in Java 6 will encounter the problem I have been having. They need to make sure they instead download and install the version identified as being for Snow Leopard. This should immediately resolve the problem. I'm not sure if there are additional reasons why using the Snow Leopard version would be a problem, except for users of older 32 bit Macs (who obviously won't have the 64-bit Java 6 installed anyway). The Universal Binary mechanism seems to work perfectly well in resolving which library to load, so you might as well have all the architectures in there (x84_64, i386, ppc, ppc64).

In general I think this would be preferable for the JJack makefile too. To get the Universal Binary libjjack I modified the gcc_mac target in the build.xml file (in v04-proposal) as follows (there's probably a neater way to do this)...

<target name="gcc_mac" if="isMacOSX">
    <exec executable="gcc" dir="src/de/gulden/framework/jjack" failonerror="yes">
      <arg value="-I/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.5.0/Headers"/>

Hello list

When I run for example the command:
/usr/bin/jjack.sh de.gulfden.application.jjack.clients.VU

I get the following error message:
/usr/lib/jvm/java/bin/java: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/libjjack.so:
undefined symbol: jack_client_new

What I'm missing? Do I have a broken dependencies chain?

Packages:
jjack-0.3-0.pm.1.1.i586
jack-0.116.2-5.1.i586
java-1_6_0-sun-1.6.0.u17-1.1.1.i586

OS: Opensuse 11.2

Ciao
Roberto

Roberto,
jack_client_new has been deprecated for a while, but it should still be
there.  Just in case, though, I would try compiling the new version,
v04-proposal, of JJack and see whether that makes a difference.  The new
version uses jack_client_open instead of the jack_client_new.
Good luck,
     Peter

I don't know all this stuff, I just installed your package and run the
client examples (VU class). So should I downgrade jack or upgrade jjack?

Roberto,
JJack is not my package, I just refactored the low-level code for my
purposes in v04-proposal.  I'm afraid I can't really comment on the official
version, v03, and its packaging for openSUSE.

Generally speaking, are we ready to make v04-proposal the official version?
That move might eventually resolve the problem that Roberto is experiencing.
Best,
     Peter
