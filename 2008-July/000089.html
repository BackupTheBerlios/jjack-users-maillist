<PRE>Oh well.  I'm pretty good with Java, but my C skills are non- 
existent.  Simply turning JJackSystem.java into a non-static object  
doesn't seem to be enough.  It runs without throwing an error to the  
Java Console, but then the program quits a couple of seconds later.   
I'm guessing this is because libjjack is unhappy about the revised code.

One workaround that I'm not happy about is that I have a master  
&quot;controller&quot; program that launches a new JVM for every new connection  
that I want to create, and the two apps communicate over a local  
socket connection.     I'd rather not create and tear down all of  
those JVMs but maybe it won't be so bad.

Thanks for your help,
Chris

</I>&gt;<i> possible to allocate any new ports after jack_set_process_callback()

</I>&gt;<i> could of course comment-out the jack_port_register() in the native  
</I>&gt;<i> implementation of JJackSystem.nativeInit() in file libjjack.c, and  
</I>&gt;<i> add a Java method that wraps around a native call to  
</I>&gt;<i> jack_port_register(). Then you can try to call jack_port_register()  
</I>&gt;<i> via that method after the client has already been registered. It  
</I>&gt;<i> would be interesting to know if that works.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> change JJackSystem from a static
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> class to a regular class and make multiple JJackSystem
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hmm, also quite a big change to JJack's architecture, but not a too  
</I>&gt;<i> bad idea. I think the reason why it originally was implemented the  
</I>&gt;<i> static way was that by the time the first version was written, any  
</I>&gt;<i> other attempt of loading the native library kept crashing the whole  
</I>&gt;<i> virtual machine. (But there might have been 1000 non-JACK-related  
</I>&gt;<i> reasons for that...) Again, if you like to, you are of course  
</I>&gt;<i> welcome to modify JJackSystem.class and libjjack.c to allow multiple  
</I>&gt;<i> instantiations of JJackSystem, resulting in multiple native JACK  
</I>&gt;<i> clients registered by the JACK subsystem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best,
