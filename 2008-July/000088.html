<PRE>Hello Chris,

&gt;&gt;<i> create and remove jack ports while the program is running. 
</I>
This might not be easily possible. In the native code, the number of 
ports is set right after allocating a new JACK client with 
jack_client_new() by repeatedly calling jack_port_register() as often as 
ports are requested. After this is done, jack_set_process_callback() is 
called to finally tell the JACK system that processing starts. I am not 
sure, but I guess the reason why jack_port_register() is called so early 
is that it wouldn't be possible to allocate any new ports after 
jack_set_process_callback() has been called once. If you have the time 
to do experiments you could of course comment-out the 
jack_port_register() in the native implementation of 
JJackSystem.nativeInit() in file libjjack.c, and add a Java method that 
wraps around a native call to jack_port_register(). Then you can try to 
call jack_port_register() via that method after the client has already 
been registered. It would be interesting to know if that works.

&gt;<i> change JJackSystem from a static  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> class to a regular class and make multiple JJackSystem 
</I>
Hmm, also quite a big change to JJack's architecture, but not a too bad 
idea. I think the reason why it originally was implemented the static 
way was that by the time the first version was written, any other 
attempt of loading the native library kept crashing the whole virtual 
machine. (But there might have been 1000 non-JACK-related reasons for 
that...) Again, if you like to, you are of course welcome to modify 
JJackSystem.class and libjjack.c to allow multiple instantiations of 
JJackSystem, resulting in multiple native JACK clients registered by the 
JACK subsystem.

Best,
Jens
