Hello,
I try to make Processing work with Jack and consequently I chose JJack to do the
job.
However, after putting libjjack.so in usr/lib and jjack.jar in the lib folder of
processing I get the following message in the console of processing :
java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: /usr/lib/libjjack.so: libjack-0.100.0.so.0: Ne
peut ouvrir le fichier d'objet partag?: Aucun fichier ou dossier de ce type
(in french)
It says that the file libjack-0.100.0.so.0 does not exist.

in /usr/lib I have :
/usr/lib/libjack.so
/usr/lib/libjack.so.0
/usr/lib/libjack.so.0.0.28

I have Jack2 and not Jack on my ubuntu 10.04 system.
Thank you for your ideas and help !

Hi,

I had problems with the 2010 ubuntu versions and jack in general. With
the latest Ubuntu 11.10 - jjack and jack it worked fine again. I
haven't checked why this is so.

Regards,

Peter

Hi,

I had this problem ages ago with JJack and Jack2 (then jackdmp) on
Ubuntu 8.04.  I had to create a symlink from libjack-0.100.0.so.0 to
one of the existing library files.  There is a problem with the
library that the JJack binaries are built against.

You could also check out the alternative JAudioLibs Jack binding at
http://code.google.com/p/java-audio-utils/ which should work without
issue, and is fully cross-platform.

Incidentally, are you using Jack directly or through the Beads
Processing library?  Beads is currently switching to JAudioLibs -

Best wishes,

Neil
