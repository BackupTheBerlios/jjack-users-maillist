Hey there,

I've been asked to find or write open source code that will allow access to midi softsynths from Java. From last months mailing list I see that JJack will be moving in that direction, but am I correct in saying not until next year?

I was wondering what would I need to add or extend in JJack to allow for Midi support? 

Many Thanks
Richard

I'd be interested to learn if you find/wrote something ;)

I can only speak for myself, but I'm not planning on implementing it 
soon :).

Basically jjack uses JNI to expose libjack methods to Java code. Are you 
familiar with JNI? Jack recently added a MIDI API, so I gather that could be 
wrapped in a similar manner.

Hey Arnout,

Looks like a mixture of snd-virmidi and the tritonus implementation of the java sound api are going to hold to key to what I'm looking for. Virmidi allows java to access the soft synths and Tritonus looks set to allow the listing and connecting of alsa midi ports that I was otherwise doing through qjackctl.

Cheers
Richard
