Hallo, 

I am thinking about using JJack to implement an audio application which 
should run also with jackdmp and windows. 

Is this possible. Has anybody done this?

best regards
Oliver

Hi,

This is not been done as far as I know, but using jjack on windows has also
been requested for the Frinika project. JJack connects to jack using JNI,
and the native library (libjjack) has only been tested on Linux as far as I
know. But libjjack is very simple and it shouldn't be a big job to port it
to a windows dll.

Check out the source of libjjack here:

best regards,

Peter
