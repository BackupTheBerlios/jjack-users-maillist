nor JJack support JACK or ALSA MIDI.

I read in a comment under 
http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/java-sound-music-software-linux-part-3
that a new release of JJack is coming up, though I don't see any recent
updates to CVS. Has development moved elsewhere?

Would adding JACK MIDI to JJack be considered in-scope for JJack? Would
it be hard to implement? Just had a quick look, and the JACK MIDI API seems
pretty similar to the audio stream API.
